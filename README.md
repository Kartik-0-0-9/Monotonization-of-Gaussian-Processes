# Monotonization of Gaussian Processes

This repository implements a monotonic Gaussian Process (GP) regression model using the `GPy` library. The code enforces monotonicity in GP models by adding virtual observations and compares the performance of monotonic GP with a standard GP on a step function dataset. The idea was taken on from Rihim채ki and Vehtari(2010).

## Features

- **Custom Likelihoods**: Implements `ProbitLikelihood` and `CompositeLikelihood` for handling monotonicity constraints.
- **Monotonic GP Enforcement**: Adds virtual observations to ensure monotonicity in the GP model.
- **Visualization**: Compares the monotonic GP and standard GP with confidence intervals on a step function dataset.

## Dependencies

- numpy (1.26.4)
- Gpy (1.13.2)
- scipy (1.12.0)
- matplotlib (1.17.0)
- scikit-learn (3.6.0)
